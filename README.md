# Stroke-Prediction

## Motivation

1.  stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures)

2. When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so it and brain cells die

3. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths

4. 80 percent of strokes are preventable, if we can predict this early we can save many lives

## Dataset 

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

### Features are:

1. gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
2. age: age of the patient
3. hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
4. heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
5. ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
6. work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
7. Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
8. avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
9. bmi: body mass index
10. smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
11. stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
